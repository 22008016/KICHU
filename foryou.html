        something special and better in all ways.
      </p>
      <p>
         You light up my world in ways no words can fully capture. 
         This letter is just a small window into my heart, 
         a glimpse of the endless love I hold for you.
         You are really special kichu, like palapozhum ninne nokkumbo like vallatah oru admiration thonnar ind you have a lot of good qualities

      <p>
        Njna ingane irikumbo orkar ind like nammal thammil indarnna moments, nee chirikkunne, ennod vazhakk idan verunne, one day kai odinju enn 
        paranj act cheythe, ratri kidakkumbo good night parayunne anitt korach kazhimbo chood edukkunnu enn paranju mari kidakkunne ravile enikkumbo
        morning parayunne, messy hair, enne kettipidich kidakkunne, ithokke cheriya cheriya moments aahnu 
        but for me they're everything.
        Do you even know how much you mean to me? Ninakk thonniyittundo, 
        how you've become such a big part of my every thought? Like seriously 
        when something good happens, adyam ninnod parayana thonunne. When I'm down, the first face I think of is you. 
        Even when I'm bored or sad or excited, it's like Kichu koode irunnirunnenkil…
        Ninakku oru magic undu, you know that? A kind of softness that's so rare. 
        Not everyone will see it because you don't go around showing it to just anyone. 
        But I've seen it. And I swear, every time I see that soft side of you, it feels 
        like the universe trusted me with something precious.
        I'm not perfect. Far from it. I get moody, insecure, emotional for small things
        ninnod kore vazhakk ittitt ind nee parayunne onnum kelkkathe irunitt ind but even then, somehow, 
        you hold space for me. You listen. You try. And that means everything to me, Kichu.
        Ninte life inte part aavunna ellarum lucky ahn kichu, coz you are that special,
        I promise, whatever we go through arguments, misunderstandings, bad days I'll still 
        choose you. Again and again. No second thoughts. No half-love. 
        And I hope… when life gets overwhelming for you, when the world feels 
        too loud, when everything feels heavy you'll think of me as your calm. 
        Your safest place. Because that's all I want to be for you. Not just today. 
        Not just when things are good. But even when everything else feels uncertain...
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy Birthday Kichukuttaaa , from the girl who looks at you like you hung the 
        moon. From the one who feels like the luckiest every time you smile. From the one 
        who prays every night to please keep him healthy and happy, please let me love him right
        and please, help in fulfilling all his dreams and wishes. 
      </p>

      <p>I LOVE YOU KICHU ♥️</p>

      <p>Forever yours,</p>
